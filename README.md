# Letter
Letter is a very simple and basic letter generator running in a browser environment. It uses the HTML contenteditable element to make editing easy. Using the print function of the browser, the letter can be either printed or saved as a PDF file. Additionally the current state of the letter is saved to the localstorage of the browser, so that you can simply return and continue writing whenever you want.
